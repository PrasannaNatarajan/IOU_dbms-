IOU
This is our DBMS Project.

This is a debt manager. It tells you how much "I owe you".

This project was developed in Android Studio.
A free server was used to store data and the backend interaction was developed in php (Php files can be found in the folder called dbms_proj).
There is also a presentation explaining relations and usability, in the Kuppathotti folder.
